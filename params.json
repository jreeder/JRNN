It has built in value cacheing, and maintains awareness of the xml file state, so look ups are quick and values are up to date with the original xml file. \r\n\r\nNetwork serialization is implemented in a way that allows for several different output formats. Currently the only output format is JSON which is implemented using the [JSON-Spirit](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20027/JSON-Spirit-A-C-JSON-Parser-Generator-Implemented) Library. \r\n\r\nCurrently there are trainers for Standard Backprop, RProp, and Cascade Correlation. \r\n\r\nThis software is of primary use to my disseratation research. So things are pretty specific to my needs. Once I've finished with my dissertation I'll clean this up and make it more presentable. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies & Use\r\n\r\n*\t[Boost](http://www.boost.org) Version >= 1.43\r\n*\t[TCLAP](tclap.sourceforge.net) Version >= 1.2.1\r\n*\t[JSON-Spirit](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20027/JSON-Spirit-A-C-JSON-Parser-Generator-Implemented) Version >= 4.05\r\n\r\nCurrently only the VS2010 build environment is kept up to date. At some point I will be adding cmake support. \r\n\r\n***\r\nCopyright &copy; 2012 John Reeder"}
