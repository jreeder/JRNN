This is a test with oversize hidden layers. 8 for single tasks and 32 for 4 tasks. 

I'm still using validation so it probably won't over train. 

I need to do this test agian without validation to see if it overtrains. 

It does take significantly longer to train. Need to add some timing functions and do this again to see how long.
