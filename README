This is a Neural Networks library in C++. 

It makes extensive use of boost shared pointers and some containers, so Boost version 1.43 is needed to compile against. 

The experimental programs make use of TCLAP for command line parsing, and xmlconfig/tinyxml for parameter file reading. 

xmlconfig is an extension of tinyxml that provides a very limited XPath like interface into xml files. It has built in
value cacheing, and maintains awareness of the xml file state, so look ups are quick and values are up to date with the 
original xml file. 

Currently there are trainers for Standard Backprop, RProp, and Cascade Correlation.
