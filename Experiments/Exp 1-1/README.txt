No Val 1 - Same as Round 1 with no validation. 
Round 1 - First try with find limits - there was a problem with the gaussian data sets and class distributions
Round 2 - fixed the Class distribution problem and re ran. 
Round 3 - Regened the guassian and circle square problems. Just ran find limits on the new dataset. 
Round 4 - Grid Search for limits instead of fixing one or the other values.
