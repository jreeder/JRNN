INDEX - These figures are rubbish. The experiments didn't adjust the impoverished amount for the tasks. 

INDEX 2 - second run with better impoverished number for circinsq and linear datasets

INDEX 3 - Same as last with extra figures for situation where all tasks are considered primary. 

INDEX 4 - Reran experiment 2-1 with better estimates for impoverished points. I'm getting funky results here. It seems that the way I'm breaking up the datasets and impoverishing them makes it possible to get radically different results between runs. 

INDEX 5 - Results from Round 6 experiments. Hopefully fixed impoverished problem, made some other changes listed in the experimental readme
